Unfortunately, there was a \(words.object) in my \(words.bodyPart), and the \(words.occupation) said I required a \(words.procedure) to get the \(words.object) out of my \(words.procedure). After waiting for \(words.number) days, I finally got set up for the \(words.procedure). On my way to the \(words.procedure), I listened to \(words.songTitle) on the radio in the \(words.vehicle), honestly a really soothing song. I finally arrived at the \(words.building) to get the \(words.procedure) after being in the \(words.vehicle) for \(words.secondNumber) \(words.unitOfTime)s long. Sadly before the \(words.procedure), I died, and Iâ€™m writing this text in the afterlife, woah."
